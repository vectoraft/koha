    data: statisticsData,
    options: {
        responsive: true,
        realTime: true,
        exportable: true
    }
});
```

### Staff Interface Integration
```perl
# Template Toolkit macro for advanced forms
[% shadcn_form_builder(
    id = "staff-form",
    sections = form_sections,
    validation = 1,
    file_upload = 1,
    rich_text = 1
) %]
